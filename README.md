## Control your EmberÂ® Mug

## Building

Cinder uses Flatpak for builds and packaging.

To make sure you have the correct Flatpak runtime and SDK installed, run:

```bash
make init
```

To run the Flatpak build, run:

```bash
make flatpak # or just `make`
```

To run with debug logs enabled for development, run:

```bash
make run
```

### Development Environment

For consistency and simplicity, a Visual Studio Code dev container definition is provided. This container contains all the required development libraries, plus some useful Visual Studio Code plugins. When actually developing, however, you'll want to run the build commands from your local host instead of within the container.
